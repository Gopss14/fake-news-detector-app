# fake-news-detector-app
Fake News Detection Using NLP and ML.
 
## ✅ Problem Statement
Fake news spreads misinformation, especially through social media and online platforms. This project aims to build a machine learning model that automatically classifies whether a news article is Real or Fake, based on its textual content.

## 🎯 Objective

-To develop and deploy a machine learning application that:
-Takes a news article as input,
-Preprocesses it using Natural Language Processing (NLP),
-Predicts whether the article is real or fake,
-And displays the result through an interactive web interface.

## 🔍 Features

- 🧠 ML model trained on a labeled dataset of news articles
- 🔤 Text preprocessing using TF-IDF vectorization
- ✅ Predict whether input news is *Real* or *Fake*
- 🎨 Modern and responsive UI/UX built with Streamlit
- 🌐 Deployed and accessible online
